## Install npm packages
First we have to install the npm package dependencies to run the angular project.
Run `npm install` (as admin) in order to do that.

## Start the angular server

Run `ng serve -o` for the dev server to start. The app will automatically open your browser.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
